But when the Escadrille was incorporated into the new U.S. Army Air Corps in 1917, the color of Bullard's skin prevented him from taking his place alongside the other American heroes of his day. But that didn't stop him.He went on to fame as a bandleader in Paris\u00a0 during the 1920's and was a spy against the Nazis. This original play by Mad River Theatre Works shows how Bullard's determination and perserverance helped him to overcome discrimination throughout his life. It is an uplifting tale of vision and hope.\r\nRecommended for 3rd - 12th grades.\u00a0\u00a0\r\nThe Carver Community Cultural Center\u2018s Youth Matinee Series engages children, teachers and families through the performing arts by igniting imaginations and introducing students to the diverse cultures of our global community, these performances open doors to greater knowledge and understanding of our world and fosters a love for the arts and learning.\r\nAll performances are free and open to the public. Registration required for all guests. Priority reservations for school groups. All matinees begin at 11:00 am and last approximately an hour.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAQs\r\nGENERAL INFO\r\nAddress: \u00a0226 N. Hackberry, San Antonio, TX 78202, between Houston and Commerce Streets.\u00a0View map\r\nTRAIN DELAY ADVISORY:\u00a0\u00a0We strongly advise using Nolan, Iowa or \u00a0Montana Streets to get here. Avoid using\u00a0Commerce, Houston and Pine Streets, all of which have street-level railroad crossings and often have slow-moving or parked trains on the tracks. Many school groups have arrived late to our matinees because of these train crossings.\r\nEvent Start: \u00a0All matinees begin promptly at 11 a.m., lasting approximately 50-60 minutes.\r\nArrivals: \u00a0Doors will open for most shows at 10:15 a.m., at which time seating will begin.\r\nHELP/CONTACT\r\nFor questions and assistance with online registration, call the Carver Box Office (210-207-2234) or email\u00a0education@thecarver.org.\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION & TICKETING\r\nWhen can I register and how are tickets distributed?\r\nWe have implemented new registration practices this year. These procedures are intended to give school groups priority access to our matinees and ensure higher attendance at the performances by reducing the number of no-shows.\r\n\r\n\r\nSchools\u00a0(state-licensed public, charter and private) have priority registration for ticket requests. Registrations for the all matinees will open for schools September 1, 2018.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\nAll School registrations will be reviewed for eligibility. If we determine your request to be ineligible as a School, your registration will be cancelled and we will notify you via email of this action.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll other ticket types\u00a0(homeschool, senior groups, individuals) will become avialableas follows: Events occuring between October - December 2018\u00a0will go onsale as of Sept. 19, 2018. Events occurring January - May 2019 will go onsale as of December 1, 2018.\u00a0Tickets are reserved for all these ticket types, so will be available effective the on-sale date.\r\n\r\n\r\nAvailable ticket for \"all other ticket types\" may increase, based upon\u00a0advance school group registrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCan I register for multiple events in the series at one time?\r\nSchools, yes; other ticket types, no.\r\nSchools may register for all of the matinees that are open to registration; however, each\u00a0matinee requires a separate registration.\u00a0Other ticket types can only register for a matinee four (4) weeks prior to the matinee's date.\u00a0\r\nMy school\u00a0group is larger than 100 attendees, but ticket requests are capped at 100. What do we do?\r\nYou must complete two registration requests.Place your initial request for 100. Later in the registration process you will be asked for the total number of tickets needed for your group, if greater than 100. \u00a0Enter the total number of tickets needed in that space. Once you have completed the registration, you will need to place a second registration for the remaining balance of your group. You will need to fill out all the requested information, which is minor inconvenience, but it is efficient in the long run.\r\nWhat if I don't know how many will be attending on the day of the event?\r\nRegister the number of attendees that are most likely to attend the event. Two weeks prior to the event, we will contact you to confirm your group's final attendance. Do not order in excess of your best estimate, as attendance will be reviewed and a history of lower group attendance than tickets requested for future events may affect your group's ticket allocations.\r\nCan homeschool households and\u00a0co-ops register as a group or school?\r\nNo. Homeschoolers may only request as an individual households, and may request no more than six (6) tickets per household. We will cancel all requests by homeschools attempting to register as a school or other group.\r\nI'm trying to register, but when I enter my quantity it says the amount requested isn't available. What's up with that?\r\nIf you're registering late, there may not be enough tickets left. We are distributing 660 tickets to each matinee. Each ticket type has been allocated a predetermined quantity. All tickets requests are pulled from the total 660 tickets available. So, if schools have claimed 450 tickets during advance registration, only 210 tickets remain to be distributed among all other ticket types.\r\nRegardless of the type of tickets being requested, when the total amount distributed reaches 660, tickets will no longer be distributed. Likewise, the number of tickets allocated to a particular ticket type may all be claimed.\r\nCan I email or fax my registration?\r\nNo. All orders must be made through Eventbrite.\r\nCan I update my registration information?\r\nYes, you may update your registration information online up to the sales end date, or thereafter by contacting the Carver Box Office: 210-207-7211, liz.cardenas@sanantonio.gov.\r\n\r\nCANCELLATIONS/NO-SHOWS\r\nWhat happens if we register but later find out that we can't attend?\r\nIf you registered but\u00a0are later unable to attend,\u00a0update your information\u00a0using your Eventbrite registration confirmation or contact the Carver Box Office (liz.cardenas@sanantonio.gov) to release your seats.\r\nAll school registrations will be contacted\u00a0via phone or email\u00a0\u00a02-3 weeks prior to the event to confirm attendance at the event. If you do not confirm your registration within three business as required, your tickets for the event will be released. If you confirm and are a no-show at the event, all registrations for future events in the series will be cancelled.\u00a0\r\nIn the event that a school registers then cancels their registration less than a week prior to the event\u00a0or\u00a0is a no-show after cancelling, we will send notification to\u00a0the registrant and the school's administrators to make them aware of the situation and of any possible consequences, i.e. cancellation of all remaining reserverations for the school.\r\nDo I have to present a ticket at the event?\r\nNo. Physical tickets are not being distributed. You will be required to check-in upon arrival.\r\nIs there reserved seating?\r\nYes and no. Seating is typically on a first-come, first seated basis; however, we reserve the right to designate assigned seats or sections based upon the registrations received for each matinee. We understand that you may desire to sit in a particular area, and will accommodate those requests if possible. The Carver will determine available seating locations for all matinees.\r\n\u00a0Saving seats is prohibited.\r\nIs ADA seating available?\r\nYes,\u00a0indviduals\u00a0requiring\u00a0accessible seating\u00a0will be offered an opportunity to request it during registration. ADA seating\u00a0may be apart from the rest of your group. If a minor requires special accommodations, a chaperone is required to accompany the minor.\r\nWe ordered tickets individually, but we want to sit together. How can we arrange that?\r\nIf you are meeting up with other households or individuals and wish to sit together, you are requested to arrive early and be prepared to enter as a group. We do not guarantee that space will be able for you to sit in a group, however. We also do not permit seat-saving for anyone not present, if you choose to be seated before everyone you're expecting is present.\r\nIs parking available?\u00a0View map\r\nBus Parking: \u00a0If arriving by bus, busses may unload passengers on Hackberry Street in front of the theatre. After unloading, drivers may proceed north on Hackberry to park, or may park on Mesquite and Swiss Streets. Do not park in the Brackenridge Learning Center or Taylor Mortuary lots.\r\nVehicle Parking: \u00a0Individuals arriving by vehicle may park free at 215 N. Hackberry, in our Center St. lot, located behind the theatre or on any available side streets. The streets are not metered.\r\nSenior Center Vans and Handicapped Parking: \u00a0Seniors and handicapped individuals should unload on Center Street, just north of the theatre, where an ADA ramp is conveniently located. Using the side entrance also reduces the number of stairs required to enter the facility. After unloading, drivers may park in our Center Street lot, located behind the theatre, which offers designated Handicapped Parking spaces.\r\nDo you offer transportation assistance for schools?\r\nYes. Transportation funds are available for public, charter and private schools until funding runs out.\u00a0To receive information on reimbursement, select \"Yes\" when asked during the registration process, and information will be emailed to you.\r\n\r\nReimbursements are capped at $125 per bus/driver, and will be limited to your actual expense if less than $125\r\nYour school group must have at least 25 attendees\r\nReimbursements are processed after you have submitted invoices (not estimates) for bus services\r\nReimbursements will be pre-approved upon receipt of your registration\r\nAs funding is limited, funds may not be available for all programs late in the season.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n", "title": "Youth Matinee: Mad River Theatre Works presents Wings of Courage", "selectedPreferences": ["Relaxing"], "selectedCategories": ["Art"], "primaryPreference": "Relaxing", "primaryCategory": "Art"}, {"description": "Join Tattered Cover for a special evening with Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist and bestselling author Dave Barry for the release of his newest book Lessons From Lucy: The Simple Joys of an Old, Happy Dog\u00a0($26.00 Simon & Schuster).\u00a0\nFaced with the obstacles and challenges of life after middle age, Dave Barry turns to his best dog, Lucy, to learn how to live his best life.

So let's get this party started!\nPASSION\u00a0brings together five decades of legendary machines, and stories of the people who made the BMW scene what it is today. It's an all-out celebration of the enthusiast experience...and that means you are an important player in the show.\nAnd...heiliger strohsack...the cars! We've got 22 pristine examples of the cars you wish you owned\u2026or still\u00a0owned. These are the machines that dominated each of the five decades since 1969, and defined the aspirations of the BMW brand, and the fans. From Bobby Rahal's Inka 2002, to the angled anger of the M1, to the Euro-only M5 Touring, you'll see a room full of the very best BMWs in the world.\u00a0\nBut we don't stop with stock. After all, PASSION is a celebration of the enthusiast. And enthusiasts like to...how do we put this...make\u00a0changes. So you'll see the Active Autowerke M3 that won its class in the 2008 One Lap of America. You'll see incredible creativity and workmanship from the best home garages. And the rumors are true...you'll see the famed Rusty Slammington,\u00a0straight from the West Coast and perhaps the most-Googled BMW of the last decade. It's an absolute monster, and you don't want to miss it.\nPASSION launches to the public on May 20, and runs through January 17, 2020.\u00a0But you've got the opportunity to see the show three days early, on Friday, May 17...IF you act quickly and buy your tickets on this page.\nThe May 17 Opening Day celebration will feature;\n- Multiple celebrity speakers\n- Multiple give-aways from your exhibition sponsors (including valuable sets of tires)\n- A free exhibition collectible for every guest\n- Music, food trucks, and general opportunities to mess about and enjoy yourself\nAnd of course,\u00a0PASSION\u00a0exhibition books, posters and merchandise will all be available to feed your unhealthy obsession.\nPASSION: 50 Years of BMW Cars & Community is presented by Tire Rack and Yokohoma, and generously supported by Active Autowerke, Classic BMW, Dinan, Kelly BMW, Odometer Gears, CocoMats / Furstil, Otto\u2019s BMW, and TC Kline Racing.\n_____________________________________\nWe're charging $25 per person\u00a0for this experience ($10 for kids). \u00a0Here's why.\u00a0Your BMW CCA Foundation is a nonprofit organization, and exists only through the generosity of its donors. Your admission fee will help to sustain the CCA Foundation Museum & Archive, and it will also help fund Tire Rack Street Survival, a national car-control training program for teenage drivers.\u00a0\u00a0\nYou'll leave with something cool. Your admission fee includes a special PASSION\u00a0collectible for you to take home.

Skelton\u2019s research has focused on integrating system science with material science to create new material systems. His contributions to innovative engineering serve humankind in outer space and on Earth. Skelton joined the faculty at Purdue University in 1975, where he served for twenty-one years as a professor of aeronautics and astronautics. In 1996, Skelton moved to the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), where he founded the university\u2019s Systems and Control Program and became director of UCSD\u2019s Structural Systems and Control Laboratory. In 2006, UCSD named Skelton the Daniel L. Alspach Professor of Dynamics Systems and Controls in the Jacobs School of Engineering and professor emeritus in 2009. Skelton joined the Department of Aerospace Engineering at Texas A&M University as a TEES Distinguished Research Professor in 2015.\nTENSEGRITY SYSTEMS: AN INTEGRATION OF MATERIALS, STRUCTURES AND CONTROL EDUCATION\nSkelton recently pioneered the mathematical description of tensegrity structures. Derived by combining \u201ctension\u201d and \u201cintegrity,\u201d the term \u201ctensegrity\u201d describes materials composed of strings and rods. His papers have explained the tensegrity nature of the cytoskeleton of red blood cells and of the molecular structure of nature\u2019s strongest tensile material, the spider fiber.\nTensegrity materials can change shape by altering their string tension. This ability to adapt allows tensegrity to produce materials systems that can modify their acoustic, electromagnetic, or mechanical properties. In addition, tensegrity structures may include built-in actuators, sensors, and power-storage devices. This versatility makes tensegrity an attractive alternative to conventional design.\n", "title": "*Engineering Honors Distinguished Lecture & Grand Challenge Scholars Program (GCSP) Symposium Spring 2019*", "selectedPreferences": ["Active"], "selectedCategories": ["Professional"], "primaryPreference": "Active", "primaryCategory": "Professional"}, {"description": "Austin Dance Festival is a three-day dance festival that includes professional dance showcases by modern dance companies from all over the country, artist interviews, master classes with visiting guest artists, community pop-up dances, youth dance concerts, and a Dance on Film screening.\n\nFRIDAY, APRIL 5, 2019\nMASTER CLASSES:\n*****Held at Cafe Dance\nEllen Sickenberger 10:30-12:00pm\nLAJAMARTIN 12:30-2:00pm\nMaster Classes are held at Cafe Dance, 3307-B Hancock Drive, Austin, TX.

Sadly, though, we often look to the things of this world to satisfy us, and we are constantly tempted to rely on ourselves rather than on God's wisdom and power.\u00a0In Secret Church 19, we'll see that all of Scripture invites us to pursue God, and we'll see how crucial the role of prayer and fasting is in this pursuit. Beginning in Genesis and moving all the way through Revelation, David Platt shows us that God has designed prayer and fasting not only to meet our daily needs but more importantly so that we might find greater intimacy and satisfaction in Him. We'll also see the critical role of prayer and fasting in carrying out the mission Christ gave to His church\u2014to make disciples of all nations.\r\n\u00a0\r\nWe are providing 100 study guides so the first 100 to register will recieve one for free. \u00a0After those 100 are gone we will need to charge a $5 fee so that we can order extra. \u00a0You will need to register by Friday, April 12th to be sure you have a study guide.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nIf you register and are not able to attend, please email bailey@summitcrossing.org. \u00a0We want to be sure each study guide is available to be used that evening.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "title": "Secret Church: Prayer and Fasting", "selectedPreferences": ["Cultural", "Active", "Cultural"], "selectedCategories": ["Free", "Shows", "Nightlife"], "primaryPreference": "Cultural", "primaryCategory": "Nightlife"}, {"description": "Meet all the Princesses at The Omaha Fairytale Ball.

In addition to Diaz, who also plays acoustic guitar, the five-piece band includes: Miguel Comas, lead guitar, producer, and background vocals; Wilfredo Gatell, keyboards and background vocals; drummer Angel Luis Millet, and bass player Alejandro Gonzalez. Sweet Lizzy\u2019s songs, all original and penned in English, are reflective of the members\u2019 wide range of ages, from their 20\u00b4s to 40\u00b4s. SLP has attracted international attention with its high-energy, genre-defying live performances. In 2017, they were showcased on PBS's \u201cHavana Time Machine,\u201d alongside Grammy award-winning group, The Mavericks. It was a fortuitous pairing, as it gave SLP an opportunity to forge a relationship with Raul Malo, the Mavericks congenial lead singer, who invited them to Nashville,TN the following year. Since arriving in the United States, SLP has performed coast-to-coast. The group, which was featured on PBS\u2019s Emmy award-winning music television series, \u201cBluegrass Underground,\u201d has been touring the nation with The Mavericks. SLP has just completed its second album, \u201cTechnicolor,\u201d which was mixed by renowned sound engineer Niko Bolas and Thom Pununzio at Blackbird Studios in Nashville. The album is slated for release in the early spring of 2019.\n\n", "title": "The Mavericks with special guest The Sweet Lizzy Project", "selectedPreferences": ["Lit"], "selectedCategories": ["Nightlife", "Shows"], "primaryPreference": "Lit", "primaryCategory": "Shows"}, {"description": "Spend the day enjoying the sounds of live jazz with a touch of soul at our 2nd annual RCRF Jazz Fest.
